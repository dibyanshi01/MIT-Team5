Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks.
This is a very complex task and has uncertainties.We learned how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network & then we build a dashboard using Plotly 
dash for stock analysis.
